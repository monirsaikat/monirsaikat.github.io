title = 'How Environment Affects Your Emotions'
+++

From the book **Master Your Emotions** by Thibaut Meurisse I found a very nice lesson. And this so true that our environment affects our emotions. Here what is written: 
> Your environment also influences the way you feel. By environment, I mean everything around you can affect you in some way. It could be people you hang out with, TV shows you watch, or the place you live. For instance, negative relatives may drag you down, while a messy desk may  be demotivating. 

> I've noticed that when I feel demotivated, decluttering my desk, cleaning my room or reorganizing files on my computer often gives me a boost of motivation.
