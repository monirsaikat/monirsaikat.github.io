ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m **Saikat** â€” a software developer from **Dhaka, Bangladesh**.  
I live and breathe code, and Iâ€™m always chasing the balance between **clean engineering** and **beautiful design**.

### What I do
- Crafting web apps with **Java (backend)** and **JavaScript/React (frontend)**
- Diving deep into **Laravel**, **Next.js**, and **Hugo** for fast, reliable projects
- Exploring **builders, automation, and productivity tools** to speed up workflows
- Tinkering with **no-code/low-code platforms** and experimenting with SaaS ideas

### Why this site
This space is more than a portfolio.  
Itâ€™s where I share:
- **Technical notes & guides** from my everyday dev life  
- **Experiments** with UI/UX, Tailwind, and no-code builders  
- **Personal reflections** â€” sometimes in English, sometimes in Bengali  
- **Projects and ideas** Iâ€™m working on (and breaking, fixing, and re-thinking)

### Beyond the code
When Iâ€™m not buried in VS Code or debugging a Docker container, I enjoy:  
- Writing down ideas (even the half-finished ones)  
- Playing with design, typography, and branding  
- Thinking about **how software can empower people**

This blog is my **personal lab + notebook**.  
Some posts will be polished, others raw. Either way, theyâ€™ll reflect the journey Iâ€™m on.  

ðŸš€ Thanks for stopping by â€” letâ€™s build, learn, and share together.
