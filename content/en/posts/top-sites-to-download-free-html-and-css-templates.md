## Licensing & Attribution Tips

* Many templates are free but require **attribution** — check the footer or the license file.
* Some are free for personal use only; if you plan to use a template commercially, confirm the license.
* When in doubt, pick templates with permissive licenses (MIT, Apache, or explicit CC0) or contact the author.
